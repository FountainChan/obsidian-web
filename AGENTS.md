## What this project is

Runs Obsidian's own renderer in a regular browser — no Electron — by shimming the
Electron/Capacitor/Node APIs it expects. There is **one runtime core**
(`src/client-mobile/`) with a **swappable backend**:

| Layer | Status | Storage |
|-------|--------|---------|
| serverless | primary | OPFS in the browser + folder vaults (File System Access API) |
| server | supported | real files via `/api/fs` |

See `docs/architecture.md` for the full picture.

## Conventions — required

- **bun, not node.** Run the servers and tests with `bun`. (`src/runtime-server/`
  still has node-flavoured scripts; that inconsistency is known.)
- **`vendor/` is gitignored.** It holds Obsidian's own bundle, generated locally by
  `scripts/update-obsidian-*.js`. It is never committed and never redistributed —
  each user downloads Obsidian themselves.
- **The bundle is minified.** Anchor any patch or edit to a **pattern / symbol
  shape**, never to a line number — line numbers move on every Obsidian release.
  See `scripts/patch-obsidian-mobile.js`, which documents this in-body.
- **No personal data in this repo.** Personal vault names, machine paths, run logs,
  and internal planning notes do not belong here.

## Before you touch the bundle

`vendor/obsidian-mobile/app.js` is Obsidian's proprietary code. We apply a small,
documented set of patches to the **local** copy. Keep that set as small as
possible, and prefer a shim over a patch whenever the same result is reachable
through a platform API.

**Precedent**: `docs/plans/runtime-platform-descriptors.md` replaced 3 of the
4 patches with a runtime shim (`src/client-mobile/platform-bridge.js`, which
intercepts `Object.defineProperty` to capture Obsidian's own `Platform`
object instead of rewriting app.js's byte-for-byte source) — read it before
adding a new patch or deciding one is unavoidable. One patch
(`vault-profile-on-desktop-layout`) still remains, as a documented exception,
not an oversight.
